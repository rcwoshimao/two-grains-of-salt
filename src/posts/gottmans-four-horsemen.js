Conflicts in relationships—whether romantic or platonic—aren’t inherently negative. In fact, they’re inevitable. No two people think exactly alike, and even with the same words or intentions, miscommunication is always possible. But what truly impacts the quality and longevity of our relationships isn’t the presence of conflict—it’s how we handle it. When approached with care and understanding, conflict can actually deepen connection, not damage it.

This idea isn’t just hopeful—it’s backed by research. Psychologist John Gottman, after decades of studying relationships, found he could predict with 90% accuracy whether a couple would stay together—just by observing how they argue.
This post can be constructed thanks to my dear therapist. The chart below explores the four "horsemans" of conflicts in romantic relationships.

There is also the 5:1 Rule: We need 5 pleasant interactions to counter 1 bad interaction.

* The horseman of **Criticism** attacks the other party's character, and in terms makes the other partner **Defensive**. On the other hand, when a partner is **Defensive**, they put up a wall and also makes the other party unwilling to communicate. 

* It is worth noting that Concempt is directly linked to the concept of Kitchen Sinking- We imagine this as old unwashed plates piled up in a kitchen sink, when two people build up resentment; it is not about the current issue, but “when you did this to me ten years ago”. When we let things build and bottle up, we might even feel disgust.

* Physiological studies reveal that individuals who stonewall experience significant stress responses, including elevated heart rate and blood pressure, indicating that they are not less affected by the conflict but are instead overwhelmed and shutting down emotionally. Notably, men are more prone to stonewalling. This tendency is linked to men's higher physiological reactivity during conflicts, making them more susceptible to emotional flooding and subsequent withdrawal.
