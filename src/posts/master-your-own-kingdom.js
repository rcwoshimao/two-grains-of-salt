# Master Your Own Kingdom - Guy Ritchie & Joe Rogan

Guy Ritche has always been a director I utterly respect and love. I have not done creative writing for a very long time, so the only way I know how to describe his humor is that it's like coal, dark, brittle, and sharp. His movies are full of people f&#42;cking up; Things gone wrong, nothing turns out according to plan, and from there comes comedy.  That probably doesn't even make sense to you who is reading, but if you have time, take a look at his movies.

Attached is the entire interview.

JR: You talk a lot about owning your path. What do you mean by that?

GR: If you don't own something, you're not the boss. You have to take full responsibility for everything you do. Why be subservient? You've got to be the master of your own kingdom. It starts with awareness—you can't walk into things with your eyes half open. You've got to know what you're getting into, and own it fully. That means taking possession of your life.

JR: Is that something you have to constantly remind yourself of? Or is it kind of cemented for you now?

GR: It's something you have to reaffirm. You drift if you don't. Whatever your form of meditation or mantra is, you've got to carve out a part of your day to remind yourself—because there's a world out there trying to tell you who you are, and there's a world in here trying to do the same.

JR: Right. That tension between the external and the internal…

GR: Exactly. And the outside world is loud—it's tempting, glittery. It's all razzmatazz. But the reason you're drawn to it is because you don't think you're enough. That's the whole model—the world wants to sell you something, and to do that, it has to first make you feel less than.

JR: That's heavy. So you don't resent that system?

GR: No, not at all. It is the system. Don't hate the game. In fact, love the game. You're in it. Accept the rules, then move with them. But remember: the world will try to define you, and you've got to be the one who tells yourself who you are. That's a constant battle.

JR: There's also that internal struggle, right? Between who you want people to think you are and who you actually are.

GR: Definitely. You're constantly trying to figure that out—am I who I think I am? Or am I just performing in this suit and pocket square? And the answer is: there are really only two worlds. The internal and the external. And there are two identities—one's real, and one's false. As soon as you start relying on the external world to tell you who you are, you're in trouble. That's ego.

JR: So what's the solution?

GR: You've got to build enough confidence to reassure yourself that you're enough. That's what all narrative is about, really. I'm a storyteller—that's my world. And every story, at its core, is just about that dynamic: the internal versus the external, identity versus perception.

JR: Can you give an example?

GR: Sure—the Prodigal Son. It sounds religious, but it's more symbolic than anything. There's a father with two sons. The younger takes his inheritance and blows it all, lives recklessly. Eventually he ends up feeding pigs—he can't even eat what he feeds them. That's his low point. So he decides to go back home. The father welcomes him with open arms, kills the fatted calf. Meanwhile, the older son's like, "Wait, what? I've been loyal this whole time and you're throwing a party for him?"

JR: Yeah, seems a bit unfair, right?

GR: On the surface, yes. But here's the deeper truth: you are the father. The older son represents your intellect—the part that tries to make rational sense of the world. The younger son is the reckless, wild part of you that wants to explore. And that part has to go out, make mistakes, get lost… in order to return and realize: "I am enough." That's the journey. And the intellect doesn't always understand it.

JR: That's deep. You've got to lose yourself to understand your own value.

GR: Exactly. You have to lose stuff—things that aren't really yours—to learn that you were enough all along. That's the essence of all stories.

JR: Is that how you approach your films too?

GR: Absolutely. Take King Arthur, for example. The father's in trouble, so the son is sent away—floats off down the river in a skiff. He's raised in a brothel, learns street life, climbs the social ladder, and eventually pulls the sword from the stone.

JR: Right. Classic story.

GR: But think of what the sword and stone really mean. The stone is the material world. It seems solid because it controls you when you project your identity onto it. Pulling the sword out—that's reclaiming your own authority. Your own divinity. You stop looking for identity outside yourself.

JR: And then he has to face his demons?

GR: Yeah, all the history he's created—he has to confront that. Wrestle it. That's the internal fight. You've got to strip away all your crutches—like, "Oh, tell me who I am," or "Let me get more money so people think I'm smart." You remove all that and stand as who you really are. That's liberation. And that's not just King Arthur. That's every story.

JR: But do you think the audience always gets that? Or are they just watching the action, the drama?

GR: Most people just enjoy the entertainment—and that's fine. Nothing wrong with literalism. You can only take in what you're ready for. But as a storyteller, I operate on multiple levels. It's my job to understand story. You don't need to understand everything—depends on where you are on the ladder.

JR: Are you a Joseph Campbell guy?

GR: Definitely. The Hero's Journey—classic structure. That path of descent, discovery, and return. It resonates because it's human. It reflects what we all go through. Campbell's not the only one, but he captured that beautifully.

JR: There's something ancient and necessary about it.

GR: Yeah. The tragedy with religion is, it literalized these spiritual stories. It's like businessmen and suits—they forgot that the suit was once a kind of armor, something symbolic. Now it's just convention. The same thing with narrative—we've become obsessed with surface. We see the body of the story, not the soul. And that's because we're too busy chasing approval to look deeper.
