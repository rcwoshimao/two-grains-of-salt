You can embed images in your blog posts in two ways:

### 1. Local Images

Here's an example using a local image from your assets directory:

![RC Logo](rc.PNG "My personal logo")

### 2. External Images

You can also embed images from external URLs:

![Sample External Image](https://picsum.photos/800/400 "A beautiful random image from Lorem Picsum")

### Image Styling Features

Images in your blog posts will have:
- Responsive sizing
- Rounded corners
- Proper spacing
- Optional captions
- Dark/light theme compatibility

> **ğŸ’¡ Tip**: Store frequently used images in the \`src/assets/\` directory for better performance and reliability.`;
