# Just failed some OAs. What's up? 
My friends always describe me as the "Go getter". For the first three years of college, I did not mind biting the bullet and fighting my life for any possible oppurtunities to absorb new knowledge. My goal was simple and like everyone else in the tech industry, to grind my arse off for a good enough job where I can contribute my force to interesting problems. This mindset granted me the power to supercharge forward and work on many great academic and personal projects, internships, and long-lasting friends and connections. Now, I have a super cool personal website that documents all my proudest projects I have created, I have achieved my goal of "Meeting a friend I know every five minutes I walk on campus", tabled at the school's anime convention and had a lot of fun, and even a partner who is careing, hardworking, and is inspired by this exact attribute of mine to work hard through life with me together. 

But what is going on? It is the start of my fourth year, and I have been feeling incredible resistance towards the possibility of failure. Just three OAs in, I have already been beaten by the shear amount of topics I have been tested on, having the thought that even after gaining all the industrial experience I have, it's still far less enough. I have recruiters reaching out to me. I have those oppurtunities, I just need the last step, just need to grind 3 months of leetcode and I might just be good to go. Why am I so burnt out... at the last step? Why am I suddenly scared of failure again, after dealing with it many times in the past already? Bewildering. 

Everyone says failure is part of the process. CEOs say it, books say it, motivational posts say it. But knowing that doesn’t make it easier. I still catch myself comparing with others, labeling myseld and putting a limit on my own ability. thougth I have became better at identifying and navigating it. I simply sit and wonder why others seem to handle this grind better than I do.

So, I went back to The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck. There’s this bit about the “Do Something” principle — that action itself, no matter how small or crappy, breeds momentum. Inspiration doesn’t come first; doing does.

> The author Tim Ferriss relates a story he once heard about a novelist who
had written over seventy novels. Someone asked the novelist how he was
able to write so consistently and remain inspired and motivated. He replied,
“Two hundred crappy words per day, that’s it.The idea was that if he forced
himself to write two hundred crappy words, more often than not the act of
writing would inspire him; and before he knew it, he’d have thousands of
words down on the page.

> If we follow the “do something” principle, failure feels unimportant.
When the standard of success becomes merely acting—when any result is
regarded as progress and important, when inspiration is seen as a reward
rather than a prerequisite—we propel ourselves ahead. We feel free to fail,
and that failure moves us forward.
> The “do something” principle not only helps us overcome procrastination,
but it’s also the process by which we adopt new values. If you’re in the midst
of an existential shitstorm and everything feels meaningless—if all the ways
you used to measure yourself have come up short and you have no idea
what’s next, if you know that you’ve been hurting yourself chasing false
dreams, or if you know that there’s some better metric you should be
measuring yourself with but you don’t know how—the answer is the same:
Do something.
> That “something” can be the smallest viable action toward something
else. It can be anything. 

Now, I personally do not enjoy your usual blog post format of having a problem - read a book - "Here's what I found out". If I write like this, this blog will transform from a fun, personal passion project into a GPT- generated crappy linkedin post collection. But I sometimes do need some reminders. I need to constantly remind myself to recalibrate my values, the values that are so shaped by societal definition of success and failures that they have almost stiffened, but thankfully not yet. Just like the author, stress, anxiety and comparison overtake me to the point of misery. I have been at the least better at dealing with comparison, as now I have developed active reminders that any progress is progress, though it is currently still easily shaken. 

I do not know how to end this post, really. I do not know where I am going with my future yet, and it's not that every post I write simply results in a good ending or success story out of nowhere. But maybe, at the least, writing this post, even when I don't have some clever take away or success story, is me "doing something". 

I don’t know how this ends. I don’t know what comes next.
But for now, I’m still here. Still doing something.
